# Installation

## Nagios Configuration

The 'notes' field for host definition in Nagios needs to match the following example:
  latlng: 66.174082,-13.119136

If you are editing Nagios configuration files by hand this is how the FULL notes
line should look like:
  notes       latlng: 66.174082,-13.119136

You can get the precise coordinates from [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com)
Right click on the spot where your device is located and select option "What's here?".
The coordinates will be set in maps search bar.

To draw connections, hosts need to have 'parents' field set up in Nagios / Icinga.

## Apache / Nagmap Reborn setup

Your webserver (e.g. Apache) needs to have PHP support enabled!
Please make sure your PHP is version 5.2.0 and above :) (see phpinfo() php function)

On some distributions you might need to install mbstring for PHP - like Fedora/RedHat:
yum install php-mbstring

1) copy the Nagmap Reborn directory into your Apache web folder
   (/var/www/ on Debian/Ubuntu, or /var/www/html/ on RedHat/CentOS)

2) copy config.php.example into config.php and edit this file (config.php)
   to fit your needs

3) Open the website of Nagmap Reborn installation
   (e.g. open Firefox - point to YOURIP/nagmapReborn)
