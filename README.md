# Nagmap Reborn Introduction
Nagmap Reborn is based on Nagmap project developed by [Marcel Hecko](https://github.com/hecko) which according to his own description is an "... super-simple application to integrate Nagios or Icinga with Google maps. The integration aims to visualize current status of network devices on aerial photography images..."

## ATTENTION
Note that his version still **in development** and therefore **unfinished**, it may contain **several bugs**, must be used for testing only!

For use in production the [stable version](https://github.com/jocafamaka/nagmapReborn/releases/tag/v1.6.4) must be adopted.

## v2.0.0
This version has as objective to bring update of the used technologies, as well as a redesing of the current structure of the project, allowing a better performance and maintenance.

Main changes:
* Use Object Orientation on the front end.
* Use of JS6 (ECMAScript 2015) features.
  * Incompatible with old browsers.
* Exclusive use of Open Street Map.
  * Due to the disuse of Google Maps.
* Complete redesing of the host status update system.
  * Providing good performance even in large installations.
