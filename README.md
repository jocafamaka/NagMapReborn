# Nagmap Reborn Project
Nagmap Reborn provides a user-friendly interface for monitoring servers and services, through geographic visualization on the map.

That way you can easily and visually identify the status of what you monitor, in addition to summarized information about each one, in addition to bringing some specific features of Nagmap Reborn;

<small>Nagmap Reborn is based on Nagmap project developed by [Marcel Hecko](https://github.com/hecko).</small>

## v2.0.0
This version brings significant logical changes, being a break-point in the API compatibility between v1.x.x and v2.x.x;

With these changes it was possible to achieve the following objectives:

* Use of modern technologies;
* Separation of front-end and back-end;
* Maintenance facilitation;
* Better performance and scalability (Handles large installations well);

<small>See how to migrate from version 1.6.x to v2.x.x [here](https://github.com/jocafamaka/nagmapReborn/wiki/Migrating-from-v1.6.x-to-v2.x.x).</small>
